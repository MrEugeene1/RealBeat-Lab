#🫀 RealBeat Lab: From Raw Signals to Real Insights
**RealBeat Lab** is a hands-on notebook project focused on working with **real ECG signal data** from `ecgsyn.dat`. We take the raw heartbeat signal, add real-world noise, clean it up, amplify it, and detect peaks — just like a real ECG monitoring system would.

If you've ever wondered how hospitals extract meaningful heartbeats from noisy signals, this project is your lab manual 💡💓

## 🔍 What This Project Does

### ✅ Load Real ECG Data  
From a `.dat` file that contains time and ECG signal readings.

### 💥 Simulate Real-World Noise  
- 🧍 Motion artifacts (baseline wander)  
- 🔌 Powerline interference (50Hz)  
- 🌀 Flicker noise (random low-frequency noise)  

### 🧼 Clean Up the Signal  
Apply a **bandpass filter** to remove unwanted frequencies and keep only what's relevant for the human heartbeat.

### 🔊 Amplify It  
Simulate a **60 dB LNA amplifier**, boosting weak signals for clearer reading.

### ❤️ Detect the Heartbeats  
Use **peak detection** to identify R-peaks (the big "thumps" in a heartbeat signal).

### 📊 Visualize Everything  
Step-by-step plots showing:
- Original signal
- Noisy signal
- Filtered signal
- Amplified signal
- Detected heartbeats
